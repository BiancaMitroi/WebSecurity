# WS5: Pizza Concept Store

## Assignment
Your assignment is to visit the store at https://websec.hofnar.ro/ and uncover the hidden vulnerability.
Explore the site and interact with its features. The goal is to find the flag hidden somewhere in the application. Youâ€™ll know it when you see it.
Your credentials have been sent to the email address you've declared in Moodle.
Make sure to also check your spam/junk folder.
Find the flag and submit it via Moodle, together with a short description of how you found the flag.
Good luck and don't trust everything you see on the surface!
